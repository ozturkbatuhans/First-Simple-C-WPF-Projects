# First-Simple-C#-WPF-Projects

This repository contains my very first experiments with C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). These are small practice projects created as part of my learning journey in software development. They are simple and straightforward, focusing on basic concepts like user input, conditional logic, and UI interaction.

## Projects Included

### 1. Dag van de Week (Day of the Week)
A small application that displays the name of the day based on the number entered (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ..., 7 = Sunday). If the input is invalid, it shows an error message.

- Input: Number from 1 to 7
- Output: Day of the week in Dutch

### 2. Temperatuur (Temperature)
A simple temperature checker. Based on the entered temperature, it tells you if the weather is warm or cool.

- Input: Temperature in °C
- Output: `"Het is warm"` if above 25°C, otherwise `"Het is koel"`

## Disclaimer

These are beginner-level projects. I'm always learning and improving. Any suggestions or feedback are welcome!
